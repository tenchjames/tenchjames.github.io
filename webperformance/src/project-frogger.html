        <p>I love this project. I really liked creating the different objects in JavaScript and using them with HTML5 canvas. I had prior experience with Javascript, but this course really took things to the next level. In the past I read books and even took some online courses. The course that was delivered by <a href="www.hackreactor.com/">Hack Reactor</a> really solidified these concepts.</p>
