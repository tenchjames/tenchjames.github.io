		<p>This project connects to the database with PHP. You should be able to search the database by last name and return the result of searching an employee table. It was pretty good to learn how PHP works and how to avoid things like SQL injection by using prepared statements. The other benefit of prepared statements is precompiled queries that only need to be parsed one time, but executed many times.</p>
